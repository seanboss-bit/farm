        <p>
          Gezawa Commodity Market & Exchange Limited (“GCMX”) is a registered
          Company in Nigeria operating in Gezawa LGA in Kano State, Nigeria. The
          market is located 22 Kms away from Kano city and equipped with
          state-of-the- art infrastructure to support efficient transaction and
          delivery of Agro based and solid minerals commodities. It is a private
          sector led initiative and is the first of its kind in Nigeria. The
          market is positioned to be the largest commercial one-stop hub for
          both domestic and export market for international standard Agro based
          and solid mineral commodities in Nigeria. The Market is integrated
          with a trading platform where agricultural commodities will be traded
          live 24/7 online. <span class="rem">
            GCMX is positioned to provide a cost-effective
            platform for buyers and sellers of commodities to transact in a
            seamless way, without having to know each other or be related to the
            trading partner and yet be guaranteed of quality, quantity, payment,
            and delivery. The Commodity markets aims to provide a fully integrated
            ecosystem for a commodity exchange. It comprises of an online trading
            platform, market information system for data dissemination; efficient
            clearing & settlement system, warehousing facility; electronic
            warehouse receipt system; grading and standardization system; network
            of farmers cooperatives; aggregators; a legal and regulatory framework
            that guides transactions on the exchange. Nigeria is blessed with
            arable land and agriculture is the primary means of livelihood for
            millions of households especially in rural communities hence we
            believe that developing the Agro, solid minerals, and energy Commodity
            sectors through establishment of this commodity exchange is essential
            for poverty alleviation and overall economic development of the
            country. Nigeria's International Trade in Solid Minerals is behind par
            and the lack of a listed investible instrument on a commodities
            exchange limits export potential for the exploration of solid minerals
            in Nigeria, principally Gold. The need to harness the potential
            development in the Nigerian Solid Mineral sector and commodity trades
            validates the well-timed establishment of GCMX. GCMX is licensed and
            regulated by the Securities & Exchange Commission (S.E.C. Nigeria).
